GX-MAC Changer

I have created a MAC address changer for Windows with a graphical user interface as a small private project.

The GX-MAC Changer saves your real Mac address at the first start, so that you can restore it without problems with the "Restore Button".

You can either enter any MAC address or create one using the "Random" button.

You can also create profiles and load them as you wish.

The small app is self-explanatory, but requires ADMIN rights to work.

It was tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11 without any problems
